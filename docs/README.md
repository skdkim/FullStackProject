<h2>Minimum Viable Product</h2>
<p>Instagram is a web application inspired by Instagram. I will think of a new name later. This application will be built with Ruby on Rails in the backend and React/Redux in the frontend. In 2 weeks time, this app will, at minimum, satisfy the following criteria with smooth, bug-free UI experience, interesting seed data, and excellent CSS styling:</p>
