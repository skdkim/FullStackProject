# Main focus:
+ Populate the feed with currentUser's photos
+ create following functionality

---
**Challenge:** White space under div of photo in feed

**Solution:** Go into the img in css and vertical align-top

---
**Challenge:** Follows is not properly making connections

**Solution:** I was just having trouble creating the right join table. User to user with one join table.

---
**Challenge:** Getting the followees in the state when on the feed page.

**Solution:** I got the followee id and follower id to show up in state once on feed page but just the id does me no good. Experimented by putting it under the User show page under userDetail to see if it would appear in there and it does but it messes with my user state. Still struggling with it. Hopefully will finish it the next morning.
